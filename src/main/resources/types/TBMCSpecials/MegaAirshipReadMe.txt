To register the craft, there must be a sign with MegaAirship in the first line. Right clicking the sign will trigger the registration script to check the composition of the build.

This model is able to utilize Cruise, Ascent, and Descent signs for moving.
This model is able to utilize [helm] signs for turning.

Being a member of the Flying Only craft, this model can Fly.
Its limits are no more than 200 height total, and a maximum of 100 blocks above ground.

This means in certain very mountainous terrain close to the skylimit, this craft must go around at this time.

Using a stick, this craft's speed is 1.0 M/Second.
While cruising, this craft's speed is .5(4+1M)/second or 2.5M/Second.

This craft's furnaces must have fuel to move, and will burn that fuel at a rating of 8.0. Coal blocks last longer than Coal.

At the time of registration, the script will check on the following:

At least 50% of the total blocks are some color of Wool to provide enough lift.
At least 1.0% of the total blocks are Redstone Blocks for the engines.
There is no requirement for Furnaces to register the vehicle, but without them, it is impossible to power the engines.

No more than 1% of the total blocks are chests and trapped chests, combined.
No more than 1% of the total blocks are anvils.
No more than 1% of the total blocks are obsidian.
No more than 1% of the total blocks are water.

If the craft takes >1% damage to its flyblocks or >40% damage overall, it will sink to the ground and crash.
